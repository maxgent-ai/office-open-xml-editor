 * PPTX internal-navigation resolution (IX-nav).
 *
 * An internal hyperlink in a deck jumps to another slide rather than opening a
 * URL (ECMA-376 §21.1.2.3.5, `<a:hlinkClick @action>`):
 *   - `ppaction://hlinksldjump` names a specific slide via its `r:id` — the rel
 *     Target (e.g. `../slides/slide3.xml`) resolves to a slide *part name*.
 *   - `ppaction://hlinkshowjump?jump=firstslide|lastslide|nextslide|previousslide`
 *     names a slide *relative* to the current one, with no rel.
 *
 * This module turns either into a 0-based slide index. The part-name path uses a
 * `partName → index` map built from the parsed slides (whose `partName` the
 * parser stamped in `sldIdLst` order); the relative path uses pure arithmetic
 * from core. The map + these resolvers are the piece the viewers were missing to
 * make an internal slide-jump click actually navigate.

 * `ppaction://…` action string OR the resolved slide-part target string. Passing
 * the action string lets relative jumps resolve; passing the part target lets
 * specific jumps resolve; a caller that has both should prefer the action string
 * (a relative action has no part target).
