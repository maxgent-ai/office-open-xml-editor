// Shared "fill the line" slack distributor for justified text — the single gap
// model behind WordprocessingML §17.18.44 (`both`/`distribute`) and DrawingML
// §20.1.10.59 (`just`/`dist`). Given a laid-out line's segments (logical order)
// and its slack, it reports — per segment — where each gap falls and the per-gap
// px, so a renderer can slice the glyph drawing and advance the pen.
//
// ── Why one kernel for both formats ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Word and PowerPoint reach the SAME gap selection: a stretch opportunity is an
// inter-word space OR an inter-CJK boundary (either side a CJK / ideographic
// glyph), evaluated across the whole line's code-point stream — boundaries are
// tested across segment edges too, so a colour change mid-phrase doesn't swallow
// a gap. They differ only in policy the CALLER owns and which this kernel does
// NOT encode:
//   • last-line policy (Word `both` / PowerPoint `just` leave the final line
//     natural; `distribute` / `dist` fill it). The caller decides whether to
//     call the kernel for a given line — the kernel just stretches whatever line
//     it is handed.
//   • the whitespace predicate. PowerPoint treats every JS `\s` char as an
//     inter-word space; Word counts only U+0020 and U+3000. Each caller injects
//     its own `isWhitespace` so the kernel reproduces that format's behaviour.
//   • the gap predicate. EXPANSION opens inter-CJK boundaries (`isGapChar` =
//     core.isCjkBreakChar); a COMPRESSION path that may shrink spaces but must
//     not overlap ideographs injects `isGapChar: () => false`.
//
// Why a per-segment / per-character model: layout merges adjacent same-style
// tokens into ONE segment, so a CJK phrase like "観察することで" is a single
// segment with no internal spaces — its inter-CJK gaps fall INSIDE the segment,
// between code points. The kernel walks the line's whole code-point stream and
// reports, per segment, the interior split offsets and a trailing-edge flag.
//
// This file is format-agnostic: no ECMA-376 §-specific policy lives here, only
// the gap geometry both renderers share. See packages/pptx/src/text-justify.ts
// and packages/docx/src/text-distribute.ts for the format adapters.
